## Description

This online workshop combined lectures about Fundamentals of Deep Learning for single and for Multi-GPUs, Building Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing Applications and Deep Learning on LRZ systems.

The lectures were interleaved with many demos and hands-on sessions using Jupyter Notebooks. For days 1 to 4, the exercises were done in a fully configured GPU-accelerated workstation in the AWS cloud and on day 5 the LRZ AI System resources were used.

The overall goals of this intensive course week, packed with lectures about Deep Learning and AI, were the following:
> - train and deploy deep neural networks to solve computer vision problems;
> - deep understanding about the fundamentals of machine learning for working with texts;
> - practical knowledge how to use transformer-based natural language processing models for advanced tasks involving languages (e.g., categorising documents);
> - learn how to effectively parallelize training of deep neural networks on single and Multi-GPUs;
> - understand how to leverage the LRZ AI Systems to perform all the above tasks.

This course was co-organised by LRZ and NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). Material developed by NVIDIA was supplemented by vendor-neutral material developed by LRZ. All instructors were NVIDIA certified University Ambassadors.
