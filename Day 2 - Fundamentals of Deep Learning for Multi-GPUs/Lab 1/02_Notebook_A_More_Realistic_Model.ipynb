    "# A more realistic model\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you've learned about the difference between gradient descent (i.e. a batch size equal to the full dataset) and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (the batch size is smaller than the full dataset, usually much smaller). You've seen that smaller batch sizes add noise to the optimization process, which can help with avoiding getting trapped in local minima or slowed down at a saddle point. A smaller batch size will also mean running back-propagation and updating the gradients more times per epoch (taking more steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll be experimenting with batch size on a more complex dataset and model. You will see the effect of batch size on GPU performance, as well as on the accuracy of training."

    "\n",
    "The [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a response to the traditional MNIST dataset, which is often refered to as the \"hello world\" of machine learning. The original MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 pictures of handwritten digits, 0-9. One of the downsides of this dataset is its simplicity. Good performance of a model on the dataset does not indicate that the model will perform well on a more complicated set of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fashion-MNIST dataset was created to be a moderately more complex image classification challenge. It follows the same format as the original MNIST set, with 10 categories and 60,000 images, each 28x28 pixels (plus 10,000 testing images). We'll be training on this dataset for this exercise, as well as for the next labs where we'll introduce training with multiple GPUs. \n",

Feel free to take some time to learn more about [wide residual networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146), the original [residual networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) they are based on, or about [convolutional neural networks](https://developer.nvidia.com/discover/convolutional-neural-network) in general.\n",

The WideResNet-16-10 we will use below can achieve with O(10 million) parameters accuracy that is competitive with much deeper networks with more parameters."

We're using Keras for this training, but the takeaways of these exercises should translate to other frameworks.\n",

    "Notice that we're only training on 1/6 of the dataset (10,000 images) for this exercise. We're doing this to keep epoch times short so that we can run quick experiments and see the effects of batch size. When we start introducing multiple GPUs to speed up the training, we'll use the entire dataset.\n",

    "It's clear that throughput is increasing with batch size. This makes sense due to the parallel processing nature of the GPU. A larger batch size means more images can be run through the model in parallel to calculate the loss before back-propagation. This takes advantage of the thousands of cores that are in the GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, throughput does not increase linearly with batch size, and there are diminishing returns as the batch size increases. Eventually, you will have saturated the compute capacity of the GPU. GPUs work effectively when they can spawn tens or hundreds of thousands of threads at once, and for small batch sizes there's not enough to work use all of the threads the GPU can execute. Since GPU processing performance depends on hiding latency by having lots of work to do, performance for small batches will be relatively poor, and performance for large enough batches will eventually use all of the GPU cores effectively, and the throughput (number of images processed per second) will approach a ceiling."

Maintaining a high accuracy over more than one epoch gives us a better confidence that the network is well trained, and can generalize effectively.\n",

Try out several batch sizes to see the effects on the validation accuracy.  Notice what happens when your batch size is especially low or high.

    "The results you obtained probably pointed you in a couple of general directions. In particular, very small or large batch sizes may not be optimal for convergence (very small batches tend to be far too noisy to converge adequately to the minimum of the loss function, while very large batches tend to diverge in the early part of the training). However, you also probably saw that there's a lot of randomness in the results, and it is hard to generalize very well. That's OK, and it's actually a good thing, because not everything you learn today will apply the same way to every model and dataset. The goal of this course is to build intuition about how to think about the process of neural network optimization, not to learn a set of rules to apply blindly in production."
